DATA_ACTION is created with the intention to accuumalate all the basic operations that are used before landing on the main path of training Data 
or preparing a data data drivenn models.This innvolves somme part of EDA, Data visualization, model selection etc. These Basic operation Provide 
clear understanding of data , for instance while working on some project I can view this repo. and can apply suitaible operation for developinng 
better understanding of data and then can do whhatever I want with my project. 
In simpler words I prefer to play with Data (which i guess is a good practice) before using it.
