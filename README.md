DATA_ACTION is created to accumulate all the basic operations that are used before landing on the main path of training Data or preparing data-driven models. 
This involves some parts of EDA, Data visualization, model selection, etc. These Basic operations Provide a clear understanding of data, for instance, while 
working on some project I can view this repo. and can apply suitable operations to develop a better understanding of data and then can do whatever I want with my project. 
In simpler words, I prefer to play with Data (which I guess is a good practice) before using it.
